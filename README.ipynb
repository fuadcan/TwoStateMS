    "The codes can be decomposed to three steps; estimating parameters $ d,P,\\mu,\\sigma $ etc., reporting descriptive statistics of the results and generating plots. All outputs are saved to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Codes are designed in R project version 3.41 for Windows and developed in both Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 8 64bit. To run the code trouble-free, please check your R version and save clone the repository into Documents folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "Run all the commands in main.R. The file contains commands used for reading, estimating parameters, reporting and plotting results for all pairs for each data. The preliminary results are saved in Results folder as .rda files. NOTE: The tables in these files are re-formed for the paper but both shares same outline."
